## Development
**Software:** NBS Presentation (version 17)

**Requirements:** two-button response device

## Administration

Run this task using NBS Presentation.

## Procedure and Conditions

This task includes one practice and 4 experimental sessions consisting of 40 trials each. In this iteration, two sessions were run with fMRI and two with EEG. The task includes two confirm (Yes-Yes, No-No) and two disconfirm (Yes-No, No-Yes) conditions.

## Output Files

Log files are output to calculate event timing.

## Scoring

- number of correct responses (per condition)
- reaction time (per condition)
